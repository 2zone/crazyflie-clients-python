The Crazyflie PC client enables flashing and controlling the Crazyflie. It implements the user interface and high-level control (for example gamepad handling). The communication with Crazyflie and the implementation of the CRTP protocol to control the Crazflie is handled by the [cflib project](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python).
